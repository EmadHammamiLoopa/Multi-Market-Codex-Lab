# V2.3 Phase 0D-L — FEATURE250 Integrity Result

Date: 2026-08-25
Status: **PASS**

The frozen development-only feature assembly and integrity gate completed successfully for all 14 BTCUSDT/ETHUSDT symbol-days from 2026-01-01 through 2026-07-01.

Final gate:

- expected_jobs = 14
- completed = 14
- failures = 0
- `PHASE0DL_FEATURE250=PASS`

Every job reported:

- `rows=345600`
- `violations=0`
- `unknown_trades=0`
- `unknown_qty=0`

The observed L0/L1/L2 valid-row reductions are explained by initial book availability, the frozen 3-second rolling-history requirement, and snapshot-reset masking. L1 and L2 valid counts were equal on all 14 jobs; no L2 row was marked valid without its required L1/base/lag inputs.

No Phase 0D-L labels, model fits, predictions, trade metrics, PnL, or confirmation-day scoring had been produced when this PASS was frozen. The 2026-08-01 confirmation day and the older 2026-08-04..2026-08-23 holdout remain analytically unopened.
